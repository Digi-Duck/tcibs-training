                Ain't no magic tool to fix it
                <br>
                You should keep your distance
                <br>
                I'm only telling you because I care
            </p>
            <p>
                'Cause I'm hard to love, find it hard to trust
                <br>
                When it feels too good, I just fuck it up
                <br>
                You want all of me, I can't give that much
                <br>
                So don't fall too hard, 'cause I'm hard to love
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm hard to love
                <br>
                Yeah-hey (hard to love)
            </p>
            <p>
                Never meant to cause you a problem
                <br>
                Here I am, yet once again with the same old story
                <br>
                You don't see the issues, I got 'em
                <br>
                Yeah, I do (yeah, I do) yeah, it's true (yeah, it's true)
                <br>
                I'll make it feel like Heaven, but I swear I'm not a saint
                <br>
                And you won't see the truth 'cause I'll be kissing it away
                <br>
                Yeah, I'll be all you need until I'm driving you insane
                <br>
                Baby, all I'm tryna do is save you the pain
            </p>
            <p>
                'Cause I'm hard to love, find it hard to trust
                <br>
                When it feels too good, I just fuck it up
                <br>
                You want all of me, I can't give that much
                <br>
                So don't fall too hard 'cause I'm hard to love
            </p>
            <p>

                <br>
                Yeah-hey (hard to love)
            </p>
            <p>
                Up 'til I'm down, I'm all in 'til I'm out
                <br>
                Got a lot to work out 'til it's all behind me
                <br>
                You know you don't play with fire in the dark
                <br>
                Protect your heart, ain't no goin' back once you start
                <br>
                I'm tryna be nice
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm hard to love
                <br>
